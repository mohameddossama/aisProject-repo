           <p> after Cristiano Ronaldo's emotional Instagram post following Portugal's exit from

            the FIFA World Cup, former India Cricket team captain Virat Kohli has come out in support
            
            of the star footballer. No trophy or victory, in Kohli's opinion, can undo the good he
            
            has done for the sport and for fans all over the world. Kohli claimed Ronaldo is
            
            the "greatest of all time" and said the star footballer has inspired millions across the globe.</p>
