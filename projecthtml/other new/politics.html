           <h1>Russia launches new deadly strikes across Ukraine
        </h1>
        <div class="pain"><img src="../IMG/poli1.jpg"></div>
        <p>
            Russian forces fired 76 missiles and carried out drone attacks across Ukraine on Friday, officials said, striking the capital Kyiv and cities in the north, south, west and centre.
            
            Two people were killed when a residential building was hit in Kryvyi Rih and a third died in Kherson.
            
            Attacks have intensified this week as Russia targets Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.
            
            Power was completely down in Kharkiv in the north and several other regions.</p>
            
            <p>The energy minister estimated that nine power generation facilities had been damaged and a presidential official said emergency outages were taking place across the country. Power grid operator Ukrenergo said energy consumption had fallen by a half since Friday's attacks.
            
            Ukraine has accused Russia of "weaponising winter" by striking essential facilities as temperatures fall below freezing. Defence ministry adviser Yuriy Sak told the BBC that emergency services were working to restore supplies but the situation was "still difficult".
            
            The alarm was raised across Ukraine and Commander-in-chief General Valeriy Zaluzhny said air defences intercepted 60 of the 76 missiles fired, most of them cruise missiles.
            
            Kyiv city officials said around 40 missiles had been fired at the capital alone - one of the biggest barrages since Russia's 24 February invasion. Thirty-seven were brought down by air defences, it added.
            
            A rocket did hit a residential building in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, leaving at least two people dead and eight wounded, authorities said.
            
            And in the southern city of Kherson, another death was announced by prosecutors in an attack that set a block of flats alight before dawn on Friday. Two people were killed in shelling in the centre of Kherson on Thursday.

            <h1>India and China troops clash on Arunachal Pradesh mountain border
                Published</h1>
                
              <div class="pain"><img src="../IMG/poli2.jpg"></div>
                <p>India says its forces have clashed with Chinese troops in a disputed area along the border, the first such flare-up in more than a year.

                    The nations had been working to de-escalate tensions since a major clash killed at least 24 troops in 2020.
                    
                    But on Monday, the Indian army said there had been a clash in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh state last Friday, the eastern tip of India.
                    
                    Both sides were involved with a few soldiers suffering minor injuries.
                    
                    Reuters reported an Indian army source saying at least six Indian troops were injured.
                    
                    "Both sides immediately disengaged from the area," the Indian army said.
                    
                    It added that commanders from both sides had held a meeting immediately after "to restore peace and tranquility".</p>
                    
                    <p>India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who addressed lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday, said the encounter started when Chinese troops "encroached into Indian territory" and "unilaterally tried to change the status quo" along the disputed border near the Yangtse area.
                    
                    He said the Indian solders responded with firmness and prevented the Chinese army from "transgressing into our territory", and forced them to return to their posts.
                    
                    Mr Singh said that some soldiers from both sides had been injured in the skirmish but no Indian soldiers had been "hurt or seriously injured" in the clash.
                    
                    He said that local military commanders met on Sunday to discuss the dispute, adding that the incident has been taken up with the Chinese side "through diplomatic channels".
                    
                    China's foreign ministry gave no details on the incident but said that according to their knowledge, the situation on the border with India was "generally stable".

                    China and India share a disputed 3,440km (2,100 mile) long de facto border - called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC - which is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points.
                    
                    Tensions sometimes escalate into skirmishes. However both sides have been trying to de-escalate since a major battle in June 2020 in the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region much further to the west - where 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers died.
                    
                    That battle - fought with sticks and clubs, not guns - was the first fatal confrontation between the two sides in the the area for 45 years.
                    
                    Another face-off in January 2021 left troops on both sides injured. It took place along the border between China and India's Sikkim state, which is sandwiched between Bhutan and Nepal.
                    
                    In September both countries agreed to disengage from at a disputed area along a remote western Himalayan border area, with both sides beginning troop withdrawals.

            <h1>Olivier Vandecasteele: Iran jails Belgian aid worker for 28 years - family
                Published
                1 day ago</h1>
                
             <div class="pain"><img src="../IMG/poli3.jpg"></div>
             <p>
                Iran has sentenced a Belgian aid worker to 28 years in prison on unknown charges, his family has said.
                
                Olivier Vandecasteele, 41, was arrested during a brief visit to Tehran in February and accused of espionage.
                
                On Wednesday, his family said they had been informed of his sentence at a meeting with Belgium's prime minister.
                
                There was no confirmation from Iran, but the news comes days after Belgium's constitutional court halted a controversial prisoner exchange treaty.
                
                Iran wants to swap Mr Vandecasteele for its alleged top intelligence official in Europe, Assadollah Assadi. He was given a 20-year jail sentence in Belgium last year for plotting to bomb an exiled Iranian opposition group's rally.</p>
                
                <p>Belgium reveals aid worker held for months in Iran

                Mr Vandecasteele worked for six years in Iran for the Norwegian Refugee Council and other aid agencies.
                
                He left the country last year, but returned in February against Belgian government advice in order to close down his apartment in Tehran.
                
                During the brief visit he was arrested by Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) operatives and taken to Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where a number of European and US citizens are being detained on spying charges.
                
                His family allege that he has been subjected to "inhumane conditions" that amount to torture while in detention.
                
                They say he has been kept the entire time in solitary confinement in a windowless basement cell and has suffered various health problems.</p>

            <h1>Former US President Donald Trump launches $99 NFT trading cards
            </h1>
            
            <div class="pain"><img src="../IMG/poli4.webp"></div>
            <p> trading cards depicting him in various guises including a superhero, astronaut and Nascar driver.

                Mr Trump said: "These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life & Career!"
                
                Last month, the billionaire launched his third bid for the White House.
                
                He triggered speculation this week after saying he would make a "major announcement".
                
                Some commentators had expected him to potentially name a running mate for his presidential campaign.</p>
                <p>Instead, Mr Trump posted a promotional video on his social media platform, Truth Social.
                
                The clip featured an animated version of the former president in front of the Trump Tower in New York, who rips open his shirt to reveal a superhero costume emblazoned with the letter T as lasers shoot from his eyes.
                
                Later on Truth Social Mr Trump said the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were "very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting".
                
                He added that the cards, costing $99 (£81) each, "would make a great Christmas gift".
                
                Buyers will also be entered into a sweepstake, with the chance of winning prizes including a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr Trump.
                
                NFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectables, but critics have warned about risks in the market.
                
                The "one-of-a-kind" assets in the digital world can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, but have no tangible form of their own.
                
                They can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets.
